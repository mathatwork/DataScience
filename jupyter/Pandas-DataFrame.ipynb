You are a restaurant manager interested in knowing whether the average online food orders per month is increasing over time.  Over one year, each time an online order is placed, you record the MONTH the order was placed, the MONTH NUMBER representation and the TOTAL ORDER PRICE in a CSV file.

So, you can't say whether FoodHub's average online food orders per month are doing better over time.  But, perhaps more data collection and analysis could uncover a seasonal pattern of higher average total order prices in the winter months and lower average total order prices in the summer months.\n",
